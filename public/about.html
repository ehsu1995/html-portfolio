  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>I'm pursuing my Master's degree in User Experience. My psychology background in college<br>
    and customer-related work experience help me develop empathy and observation skills, which<br>
    drove me to the user experience field. My skills and experience allow me to understand<br>
    user's needs and goals.</p>
